Hello! This is my page on GitHub! Yay! Yet another site spamming the interwebz!

I'm a ~~programmer~~ "*software developer*" and I have just a few things on GitHub, mostly **Minecraft Server Plugins**.

I like to "soft-mod" my routers and other devices by modifying the "firmware" (whatever firmware really means...) and I contribute to the OpenWrt Wiki in my free time. Pretty cool, huh?

Yeah I'm just rambling now to fill this page with content. I wish I was being paid for this!

Here are some of my Bukkit/Spigot plugins: [CLICK HERE like in the 00s web](https://github.com/sindastra?tab=repositories&q=bukkit)
